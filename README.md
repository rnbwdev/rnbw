# rnbw 0.1

welcome to rnbw!

## get started

to learn rnbw, go to¬†https://rnbw.design.

## run it locally:
1. npm install
2. npm start
3. visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## architecture

rainbow has three core parts:
1. action panel (left panel - react-complex-tree)
    1. files tree view
    2. nodes tree view
        1. settings panel
2. stage (live preview and design editor)
3. code (code editor - monaco-editor)

each time you change any part, the other parts change as well. this means there‚Äôs a unique id for each node so that we can detect which node has been changed and update its states globally.

each object with events is called a ‚Äúnode‚Äù - so when the nodes change, the global state also changes.

## codebase
`/config` - we will use it for some project config settings. such as ‚Äútoast-duration‚Äù.

`/_node` - all of the node apis including parse,serialize file would be there.

`/_redux` - redux code goes into this folder. each reducer has its sub-folder.

`/app` - the code related to the root app component goes here.

`/components` - all of the react fc goes here.

`/pages` - the in-project pages we are gonna build. they will work inside the browser- router

`/services` - functions or constants useful for coding.

`/types` - the global interfaces or types we use in the app.

for each react-redux-reducer, we must keep the following structure.

```
/template
	index.ts - import/export everything in index.ts. use path alias to import.
	selectors.ts
	slice.ts
	types.ts - an interface or type for each code part or fc.
```
